#Data warehouse and analytics project
# Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

## Overview

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project**! This repository is dedicated to building a modern data warehouse using **SQL Server** with a focus on the **Medallion Architecture**. Our goal is to create a robust and scalable data pipeline that efficiently manages data from ingestion to analytics.

## Project Components

This project encompasses several key components:

- **ETL Processes**: We will implement Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to ingest raw data from various sources, clean and transform it, and load it into our data warehouse.
  
- **Data Modeling**: We will design a data model that supports our analytical needs, ensuring that data is organized and accessible for reporting and analysis.

- **Analytics**: We will enable analytics and reporting capabilities, allowing stakeholders to derive insights from the data through dashboards and reports.

## Medallion Architecture

The Medallion Architecture consists of three layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion from various sources.
2. **Silver Layer**: Cleaned and processed data ready for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Business-ready data for reporting and analytics.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, please follow the instructions in the [Installation Guide](link-to-installation-guide) and check out the [Project Documentation](link-to-documentation) for detailed information on the architecture, ETL processes, and data modeling.
